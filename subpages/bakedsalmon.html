    <h2>Notes:</h2>

    <p>
        Pineapple slices, rather than chunks or crushed pineapple, are best in this recipe. The slices are really easy to stick right in there under the salmon. Pineapple chunks, and especially crushed pineapple, can be overly wet and messy. That makes serving harder, when compared to the ease of simply serving everyone a pineapple slice with their salmon. Any kind of canned pineapple will do the job here, but we do strongly recommend slices.

    </p>

    <p>
        We strongly encourage you to simply lay the salmon  in a single piece along the baking_tray. If the salmon is too long, cut the end off, and place it on the side so it can cook, too. You want your salmon to cook simultaneously and evenly.  If some of the salmon has
        folded under. it will wind up underdone. You don't want that.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you don't have any non stick foil on hand, you can spray the baking sheet.  Doing so before laying down the salmon will prevent the salmon from sticking to the sheet! The cleanup will be a little trickier without the foil to catch all the sauce, but this will do in a pinch.
